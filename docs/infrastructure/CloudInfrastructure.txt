Primary: Hetzner Cloud (€40/month):


yaml# Main infrastructure
CPX31 Server: €15.90
- Docker Swarm/K3s
- PostgreSQL + Apache AGE
- Redis, n8n, core services

CPX21 Server: €8.90  
- Postal SMTP
- Monitoring stack

Storage: €10
Network: €5

Backup/Overflow: Oracle Cloud Free Tier:


yaml# Failover and high-load handling
ARM Instance 1: FREE
- Backup n8n workflows
- AI model serving

ARM Instance 2: FREE
- Development/testing
- Backup services
____________________________________________________________________________

CDN/Edge: Cloudflare (FREE)

DDoS protection
Global CDN
Workers for edge functions

Implementation Strategy:

1.Start with Hetzner for primary infrastructure
2.Add Oracle Free for redundancy/overflow
3.Use Cloudflare for global edge
4.Monitor costs via Grafana
5.Scale horizontally as revenue grows

Cost Breakdown:

*Infrastructure: €40 (Hetzner)
*Domain/DNS: $1 (Cloudflare)
*Backups: $0 (Oracle Free)
*Monitoring: $0 (Self-hosted)
*Total: ~$45-50/month

This leaves $50/month for:

*API costs (Spider.cloud, AI models)
*Scaling during growth spurts
*Emergency resources

Error Handling Features:

1.Hetzner: Hardware redundancy, snapshot backups
2.K3s: Self-healing pods, automatic restarts
3.PostgreSQL: Streaming replication to Oracle
4.n8n: Webhook retry logic, error workflows
5.Monitoring: Prometheus alerts → n8n → auto-remediation

This hybrid approach gives you enterprise-grade reliability at startup prices, with room to scale as your revenue grows!
